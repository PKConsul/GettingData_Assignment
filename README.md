Description related to the script run_analysis.R

To run the script the simplest execution is :

run_analysis.R

There is a need to install package "plyr" before execution. Details about data, variables and transformations are in CodeBook.md file.

The results for 1st and 2nd tidy sets are available in the project. There were some issues to attach them into coursera prohject using attachment option. Seems they are in AWS cloud.
